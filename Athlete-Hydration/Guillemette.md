# **Hydration Insights from Guillemette’s Story:**

- **Post-Workout Hydration Routine:** Guillemette drinks at least 1 liter of water after each workout to ease muscle soreness and recovery. This practice of post-exercise hydration could be essential for athletes to quickly replenish lost fluids and alleviate muscle fatigue.

- **Pre-Event Hydration Awareness:** Before races, Guillemette emphasizes pre-event hydration, which shows the importance of drinking sufficiently in advance. Staying hydrated before starting an activity can set a better baseline, helping runners avoid dehydration during the run itself.

- **Mid-Race Hydration Strategy:** In races, especially her 10 km run, she managed hydration by stopping briefly at supply stations. Drinking slowly and mindfully during events is critical, as it avoids the risks associated with drinking too quickly, which could disrupt performance or cause discomfort.

- **Hydration Training Practice:** Guillemette’s reflection on not hydrating well during training highlights an essential insight: practicing hydration strategies during training sessions is as vital as training for endurance and strength. By incorporating drinking breaks into training runs, athletes can train their bodies to handle hydration more naturally during races.

- **Gradual Hydration and Avoidance of Overdrinking:** Her experience also suggests a caution against drinking too fast or too much at once. This aligns with the principle of sipping at intervals instead of gulping large amounts, which can help maintain hydration balance without causing an uncomfortable stomach.
