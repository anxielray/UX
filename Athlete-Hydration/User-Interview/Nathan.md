# **Insights from Nathan’s approach to hydration**

## **Pre-Hydration Sensitivity:**

- Nathan avoids drinking large amounts of water right before running, as it upsets his stomach. 
- - This suggests that athletes might benefit from balancing their hydration to prevent discomfort, especially by hydrating moderately in the hours leading up to a workout rather than immediately before.

## **Awareness of Dehydration Effects:**
        
- Nathan has noticed that dehydration impacts his mental clarity, muscle function, and overall energy levels during physical exertion. This underlines the importance of maintaining adequate hydration levels not only for physical endurance but also for mental alertness.

## **Post-Activity Hydration:**

- Since Nathan often feels very thirsty and dehydrated post-run, prioritizing recovery hydration could be beneficial. This approach could involve immediately rehydrating after exercise to support quicker muscle recovery and mental refreshment.

    
## **Hydration Adaptations During Outdoor Activities:**

- Nathan learned the hard way that accessible water is crucial during extended outdoor activities like biking or backpacking. For athletes, having water or hydration packs available when engaging in long or intensive activities could prevent exhaustion or dangerous levels of dehydration.


## **Mindful Hydration in Routine:**
        
- Nathan’s hydration is generally unstructured, which may lead to more extreme dehydration during exertion. Developing a consistent hydration habit, even on non-activity days, could help balance his overall hydration level, reducing the severity of dehydration during workouts.
