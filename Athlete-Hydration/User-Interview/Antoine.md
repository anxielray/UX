# Insight from Antoine

## **Hydration Timing and Alcohol Impact**

- **Context:** Antoine’s choice to drink alcohol the night before the race, along with minimal hydration preparation, highlights a common pitfall where pre-race hydration isn't prioritized.

- **Insight**: Emphasizing the importance of intentional hydration in the 24-48 hours before a race could improve overall performance and endurance. A non-digital solution could involve education through interactive workshops or hydration planners that remind runners to stay hydrated pre-race without other distractions.

## **Hydration During Races**

- **Context:** Antoine notes that sipping a small amount during races works best for him and that drinking right before an intense effort (like hills) disrupts his rhythm.

- **Insight:** This suggests that race hydration solutions should focus on providing small, manageable sips rather than bulk water. Solutions like lightweight, hands-free water carriers that allow quick sipping at intervals could be helpful, especially for runners handling varied terrain.

## **Perception of Hydration Needs Based on Race Length**

- **Context:** Antoine felt no need to carry his own water in a 14km race but would do so in longer races, indicating that runners may downplay hydration requirements in shorter events.

- **Insight:** Educating runners on the benefits of maintaining hydration even in shorter races could prevent dehydration and support stamina. An easy-access hydration chart tailored to race lengths might guide runners on recommended fluid intake.

## **Lack of Pre-Race Hydration Planning**

- **Context:** Antoine’s lack of a structured hydration plan before running shorter distances, with reliance on race-provided hydration stations, highlights a need for planning tools.

- **Insight:** Providing tools that simplify hydration planning, such as printed hydration guides based on weather, distance, and individual needs, could help runners like Antoine be better prepared and avoid solely depending on race-day water stations.

## **Potential for Encouraging Routine Hydration Practices**

- **Context:** Antoine runs regularly but inconsistently, meaning hydration practices may also vary. His experience could improve with consistent pre- and post-run hydration routines.    
  
- **Insight:** Simple, visual aids, like a checklist or calendar reminders for hydration on running days, could help create consistent hydration habits that prepare runners better for any race type or condition.
