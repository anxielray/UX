# **Pre-Race Hydration Planning:**

- Hydrate well the day before a race or long workout. Joe found that drinking water beforehand helped, but he underestimated the need to drink enough and at regular intervals throughout the activity.

- Drinking throughout the day prior can help the body retain fluids and reduce the chances of dehydration mid-race.

## **Hydration During Activity:**

- Have a structured hydration plan for the race itself. Joe didn’t focus on hydration until he felt hot and fatigued, which was already a sign of dehydration. Ideally, runners should drink small amounts regularly during the race to avoid hitting this point.

- Utilize hydration stations at races and bring personal hydration packs or water bottles when needed to control intake based on individual thirst levels.

## **Mindful Pacing and Hydration:**

- Pacing impacts hydration needs. Joe pushed himself to run faster than he was prepared for, which led to greater fatigue and thirst. A realistic, consistent pace reduces the physical strain and can help maintain hydration balance longer.

## **Hydrate Before and After Training Runs:**

- For regular runs, Joe drank plenty before and after but didn’t drink during shorter runs. This approach can work for moderate distances, as long as athletes don’t wait until they feel thirsty to rehydrate after finishing, replenishing water within 30 minutes post-run.

## **Recognize Seasonal Differences:**

- Joe found winter runs easier for staying hydrated due to cooler temperatures. Athletes can plan hydration needs according to the season, with extra focus on drinking fluids in warmer weather.

## **Balance Fluids and Rest:**
- Proper hydration goes hand-in-hand with adequate rest and nutrition. Joe felt his dehydration was also due to a lack of rest and stretching, which impacted his overall physical resilience.
