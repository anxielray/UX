# **Insights for Hydration Design**

## **Based on William's Story:**

- Salt and Electrolyte Management
Runners like William struggle with electrolyte balance, especially in extreme heat where salt loss through sweat can be high. Providing a small, easy-to-carry container for salt tablets or electrolyte capsules can help athletes manage this effectively. This container could be attachable to a hydration pack or running belt, making it easy to access during a run.

- Convenient Hydration Packs
William’s experience shows the need for hydration that doesn’t require mixing on the go. A pack with pre-measured, single-serve hydration powders or tablets would simplify access to additional electrolytes or BCAAs without the hassle of carrying bulky containers or dealing with stickiness. These could fit into a pocket-sized, resealable bag or small compartment on a hydration belt.

- Compact, Refillable Water Containers

- For ultra-long runs in isolated environments, William needs access to water sources he may not reach for hours. A collapsible water bottle or container that’s lightweight when empty but easy to fill when water is available would suit this need. A design could include a removable, foldable cup for convenience when filling up from streams or fountains.

- Focus on Body Response
Runners sometimes forget hydration needs until they feel dehydrated. A wearable indicator—like a wristband that changes color with perspiration or temperature increases—could serve as a gentle reminder for hydration without distracting from the run.

- Multi-Use Hydration Pouch for Variety

- Since William drinks both water and Coca-Cola for hydration, a pouch with separate compartments for different fluids might be beneficial. This could allow runners to carry more than one type of drink for different needs (e.g., water for hydration, energy drinks for a quick boost), allowing quick access without mixing the fluids.

- Improved Planning Tool

- For athletes needing to plan hydration levels before starting a remote or isolated run, a customizable hydration map that includes nearby water sources or stations along ultra trails could help. This could be a small, attachable map that they can mark or adjust depending on the route, guiding them to plan hydration stops or pack more water as needed.
