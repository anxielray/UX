# **UX Insight: Hydration Challenges for Social and Distance Runners Like Guillaume**

- Guillaume’s experience highlights the critical gap in hydration awareness and management among runners who balance intense distances with irregular, social routines. His training lacks structured hydration practices, especially for longer runs, which led to negative symptoms (dizziness, muscle fatigue, dehydration) during a 30-km run.

- **Core Insight:** Runners like Guillaume often face hydration challenges due to a combination of routine inconsistencies, social influences, and the misconception that hydration is unnecessary for distances under 20 km. For athletes who enjoy social aspects, the pressure to keep pace and avoid carrying extra items (like water) can make hydration seem secondary, leading to symptoms like muscle cramps and exhaustion.

## **UX Recommendations for Hydration Management:**

- Dynamic Hydration Reminders Based on Run Distance:

- **Feature:** Integrate pre-run hydration prompts based on planned distance, offering reminders to hydrate adequately prior to leaving, especially for runs over 15 km. An adaptive suggestion system could detect run duration and automatically notify Guillaume to carry hydration on longer runs.

- **Socially Shared Hydration Goals:**

- Feature: A social hydration tracker would let Guillaume set and share hydration goals with friends, allowing them to encourage each other on long runs. This feature could provide insights, like water stops or hydration targets based on distance, adding a collaborative element to hydration practices.

- **Post-Run Hydration Recovery Tips:**

- Feature: Tailored recommendations after each run can reinforce healthy recovery habits, reminding Guillaume to replace fluids after runs. A post-run hydration score based on run intensity, temperature, and distance would provide a simple, engaging way to boost his awareness of hydration’s role in recovery.

- **Long-Run Hydration Packs & Gear Recommendations:**

- Feature: For Guillaume’s next marathon or 30-km run, the app could suggest lightweight hydration packs, optimizing hydration for longer distances without needing to carry heavy bottles.

- By centering hydration within a framework of flexible but socially engaging tools, these UX features can help runners like Guillaume prioritize hydration without detracting from their social, spontaneous running routines.
