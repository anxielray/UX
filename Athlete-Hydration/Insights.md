# **Athlete Hydration Insights: Key Findings from User Interviews**

### **Introduction**

- This document presents essential insights gathered from interviews with seven athletes, emphasizing hydration routines, challenges, and effective strategies. By uncovering recurring themes—such as hydration timing, environmental factors, and the impact of dehydration—these insights are intended to inspire practical, user-centered hydration solutions. Each insight is derived from shared experiences, offering a foundation for designing targeted, non-digital solutions to support athletes in maintaining optimal hydration during physical activity.

- The insight entries listed below were deduced from reading in detail and identify recurring themes or insights, focusing on hydration challenges, routines, and best practices that multiple athletes mentioned.

## **1. Pre-Race Hydration Preparation:**

- **Insight:** Many athletes, including `Joe`, `Nathan`, and `William`, emphasized the importance of pre-race hydration the day before or leading up to the race. <u>Joe</u> and <u>Nathan</u> mentioned drinking more water beforehand to prepare their bodies, while `William` highlighted the role of balancing water intake with other hydration components like salt or amino acids.

## **2. Balancing Electrolytes and Salt:**

**Insight:**

- Athletes like `William`, `Anaelle`, and `Antoine` found it crucial to maintain electrolyte balance, particularly with salt, during long runs to prevent dehydration effects. <u>William</u>, for instance, noted the need for salt tablets or salt-based hydration in hotter conditions to avoid cramps and fatigue. <u>Anaelle</u> and <u>Antoine</u> also touched on electrolytes as an essential part of their hydration strategies.

## **3. Post-Run Hydration Recovery**

**Insight:**

- Many participants, including ``Joe``, `Guillemette`, and `Anaelle`, emphasized rehydrating immediately after running to prevent aches, cramps, or fatigue. 
  
- `Joe` and `Guillemette` both mentioned drinking substantial amounts of water post-run to recover and limit soreness, which they considered an important part of their hydration routine.

## **Effects on Dehydration on Mental and Physical  Performance**

**Insight:**

- `Nathan`, `William`, and `Antoine` all experienced noticeable physical and cognitive effects when dehydrated. `Nathan` described slower mental processing and physical strain, while `William` noted muscle fatigue and mental distractions during endurance races. `Antoine` also pointed out the impact of dehydration on maintaining pace and focus.

## **Experimenting with Hydration Types (e.g., water vs. energy drinks):**

**Insight:**

- `William`, `Anaelle`, and `Guillaume` experimented with different types of hydration, from plain water to energy drinks and electrolyte tablets. While `William` found energy drinks helpful but cumbersome, `Anaelle` and `Guillaume` experimented to determine which hydration method provided the best results without adverse effects. This experimentation was key to finding individualized hydration solutions for each.

## **7. Hydration Adaptation Based on Weather Conditions**

**Insight:**

- `William`, `Guillaume`, and `Guillemette` highlighted how they adapted their hydration strategies depending on weather conditions, particularly in hot or humid climates. `William` mentioned the need for additional salt intake during hotter days, while `Guillaume` and `Guillemette` emphasized drinking more frequently to counter increased sweating and prevent overheating. This adjustment showed a shared awareness of how environmental factors directly influence hydration needs.
