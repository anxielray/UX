# THE IDEAS

## 1. Session Preparation

- Materials: List of items (sticky notes, pens, a jar, stickers, timer).
- Participants: For the ideation project, I got some friends who work in different fields, (Brian - Business Analyst, Tevin - Journalist, Randy - Chemical Analyst, Deschamps - Life Saver(Beach))

## 2. Introduction

- Explain the context and introduce Pierre (or your persona).
    State the chosen problem statement: “How might we help Pierre measure and prepare his hydration before a race?”

## 3. Session Instructions

- Request participants to turn off their phones.
- Explain the session’s goal: “Find as many solutions to the problem statement under varying constraints.”
- Outline constraints (e.g., Pierre being blind, a bird, etc.).

## 4. Execution of Rounds

- Description of Rounds:
- List each constraint revealed in each round.
- Document a brief summary of each participant's ideas, noting key solutions.
    - Example:
        Constraint 1 (Pierre was blind): “Participant 1(Brian) suggested a hydration system with auditory alerts, Participant 2 proposed tactile markers.”
- Timer Settings: Specify the time allotted to eah idea(e.g., 1 minute per constraint).

## 5. Collecting and Voting on Ideas

- Gather all sticky notes.
- Ask each participant to read their ideas aloud.
- Describe the voting process: Each participant receives 3 stickers to vote for the top ideas.

## 6. Evaluation & Selection

- Note the ideas that received the most votes.
- If no standout ideas emerge, explain how you organized them by “easy to implement” and “efficient” on a board.
- Document the final selected idea with a rationale for why it was chosen.

## 7. Conclusions & Reflections

- Summary of key insights from the session.
- Reflections on how creative constraints influenced ideation.

- Example Documentation Entry:

  - Constraint Round 1: If Pierre was blind

        - Ideas Generated:
            - Participant A: "Audible hydration bottle to signal intake levels."
            - Participant B: "Braille-labeled water measurement cups."
            - Participant C: "Vibrating hydration watch to remind fluid intake."

Voting Results:

    Winning Idea: Audible hydration bottle.

Final Idea: “Develop an audible hydration bottle with automated reminders.”

Conclusion: This ideation exercise showed that creative constraints encouraged diverse solutions, revealing novel ideas like sensory adaptations for hydration management.
