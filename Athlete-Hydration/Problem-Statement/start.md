- A problem statement typically includes the following information:

    - Who is affected by the problem 

- When and where the problem occurs 
- The impact of the problem 
- Information about the users who are experiencing the problem 

### Format

- A traditional problem statement is structured as [A user] needs [need] in order to accomplish [goal]. 
- A typical problem statement in UX design is usually concise, ranging from 2 to 3 sentences. It should clearly define the core problem the user faces, provide context, and include a specific goal for solving the issue. Keep it focused on the user and their needs, avoiding unnecessary detail or vagueness.
- The goal is to provide a clear direction for designing solutions.
