# **Summary:**

- Dehydration negatively impacts athletic performance, and even a loss of 2% body weight can impair physical performance. A loss of more than 5% can reduce work capacity by 30%. Sprint athletes may experience a performance decrease of up to 45% with a 2.5% body weight loss, and endurance athletes are also affected by dehydration, especially in hot conditions. Studies show that dehydration reduces maximal aerobic power (VO2 max), endurance capacity, and performance in distance running. Additionally, dehydration increases the risk of exhaustion during prolonged activities, such as treadmill walking in extreme heat, with reduced tolerance for heat strain and lower exercise endurance.

- The physiological effects of dehydration include reduced blood volume, decreased skin blood flow, lower sweat rate, and impaired heat dissipation, which all contribute to an increased core temperature. This, in turn, elevates the rate of glycogen breakdown in muscles, leading to faster fatigue. Dehydration also reduces the body's ability to cool itself through sweating and blood flow, causing a faster rise in core temperature during exercise. Heat acclimatization helps, but dehydration negates its benefits, making the body less able to tolerate heat strain.

- In summary, dehydration impacts cardiovascular function, thermoregulation, and muscle endurance, thereby significantly hindering performance, especially under hot conditions.

## **Insights**

### **Insight on Kidney Health:**

**Insight:** Consistent hydration supports kidney function by aiding in waste removal, which helps prevent kidney stones.

_Justification:_ "Regular water intake facilitates kidney efficiency, reducing the risk of stone formation." — "Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated," Vol. 15, Issue 2.

### **Key Figure on Water Intake Recommendation:**

**Insight:** Health experts generally recommend about 2 liters of water per day for the average adult to maintain optimal health.

_Justification:_ "An intake of roughly 2 liters per day meets the body’s water demands under normal conditions." — "Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated," Vol. 15, Issue 2.

### **Hydration’s Role in Joint Health:**

**Insight:** Hydration is crucial for joint lubrication, as water is a major component of synovial fluid, which cushions joints.

_Justification:_ "Water forms a significant part of the synovial fluid that protects joints, supporting smooth movement and reducing friction." — "Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated," Vol. 15, Issue 2.

### **Insight on Skin Hydration and Appearance:**

**Insight**: Drinking sufficient water can help improve skin appearance by maintaining moisture levels, which supports skin elasticity.

_Justification:_ "Adequate hydration enhances skin elasticity, providing a healthier and more vibrant look." — "Health Benefits of Staying Hydrated," Vol. 15, Issue 2.
